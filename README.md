# Isaac Clayton's [Website](https://website.slightknack.workers.dev)

I've always wanted to write a website for myself, and things recently fell in place for that to become a possibility. This website is versioned, content-addressed, and lightning quick â€” the back-end is written in Rust; pages are served through Cloudflare's edge network via WASM Workers + KV.

I gave a talk at a Utah Rust 2020 meetup where I explain some context around this project and walk through a small demo. You can find the [slides and recorded presentation here](https://github.com/slightknack/wasm-rust-pres).
